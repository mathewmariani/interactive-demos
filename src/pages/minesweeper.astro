  <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
  <p>
    Minesweeper is a logic puzzle video game genre generally played on personal
    computers. The game features a grid of clickable tiles, with hidden mines
    scattered throughout the board. The objective is to clear the board without
    detonating any mines, with help from clues about the number of neighboring
    mines in each field.
