  <p>
    The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making strategy used in Tic-Tac-Toe AI
    to find the optimal move. It recursively explores all possible game states,
    assigning scores based on win/loss conditions. The AI maximizes its own
    score while assuming the opponent plays optimally to minimize it. By
    evaluating each moveâ€™s outcome, Minimax ensures the AI always selects the
    best possible move, making it nearly unbeatable.
