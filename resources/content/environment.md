# Development Environment

The development environment utilizes [VSCode][], [Cmake][] and the [Emscripten SDK][] to enable an IDE-like workflow that produces a wasm runtime which can be ran in the browser.

### Prerequisites

First make sure that the following tools are in the path:

*   git
*   cmake
*   ninja

### Extensions

You’ll need the following VSCode extensions:

*   [ms-vscode.cpptools][]
*   [ms-vscode.cmake-tools][]
*   [ms-vscode.wasm-dwarf-debugging][]
*   [ms-vscode.live-server][]


### Getting Started

First youre going to want to clone the repository, and update out submodules.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mathewmariani/gpr340-sokol
git git submodule update --init --recursive
```

We're also going to want to install the Emscripten SDK. This will allow us to compile C++ source code to WebAssembly for execution the browser.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate --embedded latest
cd ..
```

### Project Structure

This project was intentionally designed to be **\*small\*** and easily comprehensible. Let's look at some important folders:

*   `assignments/` – Each assignment is its own project.
*   `build/` - Intermediate files used by cmake, and other build output. 
*   `libs/` - External libraries linked to each assignment.


#### External Libraries

The first thing we should look at are the external libraries, and what they offer:

*   `glm` - Mathematics library for graphics.
*   `imgui` - Bloat-free graphical user interface library.
*   `sokol` - Simple cross-platform libraries for platform abstraction and 3D-API wrapping.
*   `stb` - Image loading/decoding from file/memory.

All of these libraries will be used throughout the course.


#### Assignments

Each assignment is an individual project file that will need to be added to `assignmnets/CMakeLists.txt`.
Behind the scenes a compilation target will be created, and the libraries will automatically be linked and included.

`batteries` is a small library of helpful data-structures, functions, and boilerplate. You are encouraged to create your own library to add desired functionality.
